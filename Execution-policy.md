# Execution Policy

- Each query executed exactly once.
- No cherry picking or replacement of weak outputs.
- Collapses were preserved deliberately as evidence of epistemic robustness.
- Q5 was rerun *only* because of a UnicodeEncodeError (runtime failure).
- Temperature deterministic intent = 0.0.
- Retrieval is dynamic; graph structure may vary slightly in future runs.
